# EBS vs Instance Store

## Elastic Block Store (EBS)
- Persistent block storage.
- Survives instance stop/start.
- Can attach/detach from EC2.
- Good for OS, databases, applications.

## Instance Store
- Temporary storage physically attached to host.
- **Data lost** when instance stops/terminates.
- Very fast (good for caching/temp data).
- Canâ€™t be resized or backed up independently.
